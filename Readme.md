## Features:

### Form Validation:

- Developed a function that called 4 slave functions to ensure that the parameters supplied in the inputs corresponded to the assignment requirements.

### Responsiveness:

- /index.html was optimized for iPad Mini resolution 768 x 1024 - Google Chrome.

### Backend Data Retrieval:

- Simply, through a fetch from the assigned endpoint and injected the data directly into /html/projectpage.html.

### Backlog (Areas for Improvement):

- I would have liked to implement a responsive hamburger menu for the website. Additionally, I intended to optimize the entire website for smaller mobile devices.

- There were several aspects of the user interface that could have been enhanced visually. 

- Ideally, I would have preferred to import all data dynamically from the backend, eliminating the need for hardcoding and ensuring the project remains flexible and easily maintainable in the future.
